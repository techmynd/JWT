Usage
Clone the repo: git clone git@github.com:scotch-io/node-token-authentication
Install dependencies: npm install
Change SECRET in config.js
Add your own MongoDB database to config.js
Start the server: node server.js
Create sample user by visiting: http://localhost:8080/setup
Once everything is set up, we can begin to use our app by creating and verifying tokens.

Getting a Token
Send a POST request to http://localhost:8080/api/authenticate with test user parameters as x-www-form-urlencoded.

  {
    name: 'Nick Cerminara',
    password: 'password'
  }
Verifying a Token and Listing Users
Send a GET request to http://localhost:8080/api/users with a header parameter of x-access-token and the token.

You can also send the token as a URL parameter: http://localhost:8080/api/users?token=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE

Or you can send the token as a POST parameter of token.
